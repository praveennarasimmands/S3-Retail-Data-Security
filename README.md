# S3 Retail Data Security Project

## Domain: Retail

### Problem:
The retail industry processes sensitive customer information, including personal details, payment card information, and purchase history. Ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of this data is crucial to maintain customer trust and comply with regulations like PCI-DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard). Retail organizations must ensure that only authorized personnel can access financial records or transaction data, preventing data breaches and fraud.

### Solution:
This project demonstrates how to use AWS S3, IAM roles, and bucket policies to secure retail transaction data. By restricting access based on user roles (e.g., finance team members) and enforcing access control using IP addresses, we ensure that only authorized individuals can manage sensitive retail data.

### Key Features:
- **S3 Bucket Setup**: Securely store customer payment and transaction data in S3.
- **Role-based Access Control**: Use IAM policies to grant access to specific user roles (e.g., finance team).
- **Bucket Policy**: Create S3 bucket policies to ensure that only the finance team can access sensitive data.
- **IP-based Access Control**: Restrict access based on the IP addresses of the finance teamâ€™s network.

### Implementation:
1. **Create the S3 Bucket**: Store retail transaction data securely in S3.
2. **Define IAM Policies for Retail Finance Team**: Limit access to financial records for the finance team only.
3. **Apply S3 Bucket Policy**: Restrict access to the S3 bucket for authorized users based on roles and IP addresses.

### Files:
- `retail-finance-policy.json`: IAM policy to grant access to the finance department.
- `retail-bucket-policy.json`: S3 bucket policy for retail transaction data.

### Instructions:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Set up an S3 bucket for retail transaction data.
3. Apply IAM policies for the finance team to limit access to sensitive data.
4. Configure bucket policies and IP-based restrictions.
